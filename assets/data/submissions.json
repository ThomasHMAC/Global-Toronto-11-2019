In this framework, each pipeline consists of a number of preprocessing steps, where each proprocessing step is an object of class PreprocessingStep. This design allows to construct versatile pipelines in which different preprocessing steps can be used in any desired order.",

   "project_title": "Mapping the mouse brain to the human brain",
   "project_pitch": "As subjects of MRI experiments, both mice and humans have contributed to our understanding of the how brain develops, functions, and changes in disease states. Yet, our knowledge derived from both fields remains to be integrated and translated between species. With mouse neuroimaging becoming more popular, a tool to translate findings from the mouse to humans and vice versa could be valuable. In other words, if a treatment in a mouse causes brain region A to change in structure, can we predict which regions in the human brain will show a similar change, if at all?\n\nThis project is essentially about building a function that maps a given coordinate in one species to (potentially multiple) coordinates in the other species, with the goal being that this mapping reflects some sort of similarity in the function and evolutionary origins of the pair of coordinates. The complex folding structure of the human cortex, compared to the flat mouse cortex, makes this anatomical registration challenging. Instead, I propose that we use spatial expression patterns of homologous genes as a proxy for common function and origin, and connect regions across species by similarities in their gene expression profiles. Spatial gene expression data for both species are available from the Allen Institute. \n\n",

   "project_pitch": "C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference for Neuroimaging in R. The \"C\" stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically: covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques.\n\nCovSTATIS is the base method in C-MARINeR. CovSTATIS is effectively a multi-table PCA designed for covariance matrices. CovSTATIS allows for multiple connectivity (correlation or more generally covariance) matrices to be integrated into a single analysis. CovSTATIS produces component (a.k.a. factor) maps with respect to the compromise matrix (weighted average), and then projects each individual matrix back onto the components. \n\nK+1CovSTATIS is a novel extension of CovSTATIS that allows us to use a \"target\" or reference matrix. For example, a theoretical resting state structure (a la Yeo/Schaffer maps). K+1CovSTATIS also produces component (a.k.a. factor) maps with respect to the compromise matrix (weighted average), except the compromise matrix is no longer a weighted average of all matrices, rather, it is a weighted average of all matrices with respect to a \"target\" matrix. Then each of those matrices are projected back onto the components.\n",
   "goals": "Our primary goal is to make a small package and ShinyApp to perform the same types of analyses we use for integrating and analyzing multiple connectivity matrices (across tasks, individuals, and groups). We want to make CovSTATIS and similar methods easily accessible.\n\nSee our Github page for task lists, tools, and how to participate",
